* `POST /api/auth/login` – Login user and return JWT token

### **Products**

* `GET /api/products` – Get all products
* `GET /api/products/:id` – Get product by ID
* `POST /api/products` – Add new product (Admin only)
* `PUT /api/products/:id` – Update product (Admin only)

## 8. Authentication

* **Method:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) + bcrypt
* **Workflow:**

  * On login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client
  * The client stores the token in local storage
  * Protected routes require the token in the `Authorization` header
* **Password security:** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in the database
